<h2>LESSON 1: SETUP</h2>
<div id="section-installing-r-and-rstudio" class="section level3">
<h3>1.1 Installing R and RStudio</h3>
<p>For this course, there are two (free) associated programs you will
need to install: R and RStudio. R is an opensource programming language
designed for statistical computing. It is widely used by ecologists for
quantitative analyses. RStudio is an environment for R that is more
user-friendly than the standard R environment, so it is the environment
we will use in this class. We will also install an addition set of
tools, RTools, which is needed to run one of the packages that we will
use in this class.</p>
<div id="section-installing-r" class="section level4">
<h4>Installing R</h4>
<p>To install R, first go to the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R
website</a>. Under the “Getting Started” heading, you should see a link
to download R. Click on this link, and it will take you to a page to
select a CRAN mirror (a webserver that stores versions of R). You will
want to select the CRAN mirror at the nearest location, so scroll down
to the list of USA locations and click on the link for Iowa State
University. On the new page, choose the correct R download for your
system (Linux, Mac, or Windows) from the “Download and Install R” box at
the top of the page. Details for each are below.</p>
<div id="section-linux" class="section level5">
<h5>Linux:</h5>
<p>Each of the Linux options (Debian, Fedora/Redhat, or Ubuntu) will
provide you with the commands you need to run to install the latest
version of R. If you have problems with the installation, please get in
touch with me.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-mac" class="section level5">
<h5>Mac:</h5>
<p>On the new page, you should see a list of R packages, with the most
up-to-date packages first. The package you will want depends on your
operating system. The newest version is for macOS 11 and higher. If you
are running an older version, select the appropriate package based on
the system information provided for each package. When you click on the
link for the package you need, it will prompt you to download the
application setup file. Be sure to pay attention to where you save the
file. Once you have downloaded the file, open the file and follow the
installation instructions. You should not need to change any of the
default installation settings. When you finish the installation process,
you should by ready to run R on your computer.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-windows" class="section level5">
<h5>Windows:</h5>
<p>On the new page, select the “base” option from the list of
subdirectories. At the very top of the next page, there will be a
download link for the latest version of R. Select this link, and it will
prompt you to download the application setup file. Be sure to pay
attention to where you save the file. Once you have downloaded the file,
open the file and follow the installation instructions. You should not
need to change any of the default installation settings. When you finish
the installation process, you should by ready to run R on your
computer.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-installing-rstudio" class="section level4">
<h4>Installing RStudio</h4>
<p>To install RStudio, first go to the <a
href="https://www.rstudio.com">RStudio Website</a>. In the upper
right-hand corner, hit the “Download RStudio” button. On the new page,
scroll down to “RStudio Desktop” and select the “Download RStudio”
button. Scroll down to “Step 2: Install RStudio Desktop”. If you are
running Windows on your computer, there is a button to “Download RStudio
Desktop for Windows” just below this heading. For other operating
systems or old versions of Windows, continue scrolling down. Under the
“All Installers and Tarballs” heading, there is a link to older versions
of RStudio for Windows if you need that. Below that is a list of
downloads for all operating systems. Select the appropriate system for
your computer and save the application setup file. Finally, open the
setup file and follow the installation instructions. When you finish the
installation, RStudio should be ready to run on your computer.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-installing-rtools" class="section level4">
<h4>Installing Rtools</h4>
<p>Some R packages, which provide additional useful functions for
analysis, are only available as source code, and they have to be
compiled before they can be used. There are some additional steps we
will need to take to make sure your computers can compile the code.
Before completing these steps, be sure that R and RStudio are closed on
your computer.</p>
<div id="section-mac-1" class="section level5">
<h5>Mac:</h5>
<p>If you have a Mac, you do not actually need to download RTools.
Instead, open a terminal window (click the spotlight search button on
your computer, and search for “Terminal”). Then copy and paste the code
below into the terminal and hit “return”.</p>
<p>xcode-select –install</p>
<p>You might need to enter your computer password to allow the
installation. Next, follow any onscreen instructions and allow the
installation to finish. Once this is done, you should be good to go!</p>
</div>
<div id="section-windows-1" class="section level5">
<h5>Windows:</h5>
<p>If you have a PC, you will need to install RTools. Go to the <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/">RTools download
website</a>. Unless you are running an old version of R (you probably
are not, unless you installed R years ago and have not updated), select
the “RTools 4.4” link. On the new page, look for the Rtools44 installer
link about halfway down the page, in the Installing Rtools 44 section.
Click on this link to download the exe file. Run the file and follow the
onscreen instructions to complete the installation. You may use the
default settings. After the installation has finished, you should be
set!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-layout-of-rstudio" class="section level3">
<h3>1.2 Layout of RStudio</h3>
<p>To run R via RStudio, simply open the RStudio application. It will
automatically connect with R, so you do not need to open R separately.
When you open RStudio, the page should look something like this:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="RStudio.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Image of RStudio layout, showing the console,
environment, and help tabs</p>
</div>
<p>There are three main panels that you will see. The panel on the left
panel is the console: the place where you will run your code and view
the output. R is a programming language, so rather than selecting
options from drop-down menus, you will be writing code that you will run
to complete your statistical analyses.</p>
<p>The two panels on the right will not be used to write code, but they
can help you stay organized and keep track of what you are doing. The
upper right-hand panel is primarily for viewing the objects (such as
variables and data frames; if this still doesn’t make sense, you will
learn more about objects later) you create as you run your programs. You
can view all the objects you have saved, what they are named, and what
type of objects they are. The bottom right-hand panel has multiple tabs
with different purposes. Here are the ones you should be familiar with:
1. Files: This tab has a file manager, similar to the file explorer on
your computer. Here you can view the files in your directory. 2. Plots:
When you create a plot, this is where you can view it. 3. Packages: R
has packages you can install, which will give you access to additional
functions. This tab shows you the packages you have installed and the
packages you can install. 4. Help: Unsure what a function does or what
arguments you need to include in a function? You can search for
information about functions and other aspects of R in the Help tab.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-r-script-files" class="section level3">
<h3>1.3 R script files</h3>
<p>As described above, you will be running your code in RStudio’s
console. However, when you type code directly into the console, you
cannot save that code. Therefore, you can instead write your code in an
R script file, which is essentially a text file for writing R code. You
can run code directly from the R script files and save the files so you
can continue to work on them and run them at a later time. They are also
a good resource for future projects. Often, we will end up using similar
programs for multiple projects, so if we save our code, we can use it as
a starting point for future project, instead of starting from nothing. I
recommend that you ALWAYS code in a script file, instead of the console,
unless you know it’s just a one-off command.</p>
<p>To open a script file, go to the file menu at the top of the window,
hover over “New File”, and then select “R Script” from the new menu that
appears. Now you will see a new panel on the top left-hand side of the
screen where you can view and edit your script files. You can now type
code into the script, save it, and run it. When you run the code, you
will see it appear in the console.</p>
<p>To run the code from an R script, you can place your cursor in the
line of code you want to run or highlight the code you want to run, then
either click the run button (see picture below) or hit “ctrl + enter”
(PC) or “cmd + return” (Mac). Alternatively, you can copy and paste the
code from the script into the console.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="RunRCode.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Image of RStudio layout, showing the “run code”
button at the top of an R script</p>
</div>
<p>When you write code in an R script, it is extremely helpful to
include comments in your code, as a reminder of what you are doing in
each step. To make a comment in your script file, first type #, followed
by your comment. The # will tell R that the following text should not be
run as code. In Lesson 2, you will see some examples of code
comments.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-installing-packages" class="section level3">
<h3>1.4 Installing packages</h3>
<p>One nice thing about R is that it is opensource software. This means
it is free, but it also means that users can write packages for the
program. These packages contain new functions that are not included in
base R. Other users can install the packages, giving them access to the
new functions. There are many, many R packages out there designed for
different purposes. In this class, we will primarily use two packages,
in addition to the base R functions.</p>
<div id="section-time-to-write-your-first-piece-of-code-in-r"
class="section level4">
<h4>Time to write your first piece of code in R!</h4>
<p>The two packages we will use in this class are the
<strong>tidyverse</strong> package (useful for data management and
visualization; it is actually a set of several packages) and the
<strong>lme4</strong> package (useful for the type of statistical model
we will use most in this class). We will install these two packages
now.</p>
<p>This is one of the rare cases where it is fine to type the code
directly into the console because once you install the packages, you
won’t need to install them again unless you update R. It will just take
a single line of code to install both packages. Put your cursor in the
console, next to the “&gt;” symbol and type the following lines of code
(be sure to pay attention to punctuation and case):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;)
install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;)
install.packages(&quot;lme4&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Then hit enter. You should see a bunch of text pop up in the console
as the packages install. Once the packages install, you should see the
“&gt;” in the console again, indicating that you can type more code into
the console. Sometimes warnings will show up in the console when you
install packages, but they are usually nothing to worry about. We can
deal with them on a case-by-case basis if necessary. If, after you run
the line of code, you see only a few lines of text show up in the
console, and then it stops, check for a dialogue box asking if you want
to install the package in your personal library. If you get this
message, click “yes”, and the packages should continue to install.</p>
<p>If you need to install other packages, you can just use the same
<code>install.packages()</code> command and simply put the name of the
package you need inside the parentheses.</p>
