<h2>Lesson 6: VISUALING STATISTICAL MODELS</h2>
<p>In Lesson 5, you practiced building and parameterizing linear models
in R. In this lesson, you will learn different ways of visualizing these
models. For this lesson, we will work with the same models you built in
Lesson 5, so go ahead and open your R script from lesson 5. You can add
the code for this Lesson to the same script file, if you would like.</p>
<p>We will use the <strong>ggplot2</strong> package to create these
graphs, so load that package now.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ggplot2)</code></pre>
<div id="discrete-predictor-variable" class="section level3">
<h3>6.1 Discrete predictor variable</h3>
<p>We will once again start with our civu example with a discrete
(categorical) independent variable and a continuous dependent
variable.</p>
<p>Using the script file from Lesson 5, run all of the code you wrote
for the civu example, including the building of both the null and
alternative models. Be sure you first have your working directory set to
the folder containing the civu data set.</p>
<p>We will learn two different ways of visualizing the data and model.
The first does not explicitly use the model output, but the second will
allow you to visualize how the distribution of the data compares to the
distribution predicted by the model.</p>
<div id="box-plots" class="section level4">
<h4>Box plots</h4>
<p>The first type of graph we will make is a boxplot. Good news! You
already practiced making this type of plot in Lesson 4!</p>
<p>As I mentioned, this type of plot does not explicitly incorporate the
model output. However it will show information similar to the parameters
R calculated when you ran the models in R: central tendency and
variation.</p>
<p>Let’s start with our box plot for our null model. Just like when we
worked with ggplot in the past, we will start by specifying the data and
variables we want to include in our graph. Then we add layers to the
code to specify the type of graph we want. For this first graph, we will
use the civu data set. Because this is our null model, we are assuming
that herbivory does not affect plant density, so we just want to graph a
single distribution for all of our data. Therefore, unlike when we
created box plots before, when we specified both and x and y variable,
we will just specify the y variable this time (our plant density
variable). In the following lines of code, we tell R to make a box plot,
change the axis label, and use the classic theme that removes the
background color and gridlines. Because R likely classified our
herbivory treatment variable as a numeric variable when we loaded the
data, we will also reclassify that variable as a factor before we make
our graph.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>civu$herbivory &lt;- as.factor(civu$herbivory)

ggplot(data = civu, aes(y = density_2006)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(y = &quot;Density in 2006&quot;) +
  theme_classic()</code></pre>
<p><img src="RHandbook_6_files/figure-html/null_box-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Now let’s make an equivalent plot for our alternative model. We will
make a box plot, just as before, but this time including herbivory as
our x variable.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = civu, aes(x = herbivory, y = density_2006)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = &quot;Herbivory treatment&quot;, y = &quot;Density in 2006&quot;) +
  theme_classic()</code></pre>
<p><img src="RHandbook_6_files/figure-html/alt_box-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>This type of plot is commonly used both in exploratory analysis and
as a final plot that might be included in a manuscript. Although it does
not explicitly use the output of the model, I will always accept this
type of plot as a good way of summarizing the distribution of your data
and how that distribution might vary between categories.</p>
</div>
<div id="density-plots" class="section level4">
<h4>Density Plots</h4>
<p>The second type of plot we will make is more complicated and probably
less commonly used. However, I want you to create them in this exercise
for two reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>This type of plot reinforces that when we build models, we are
using our data to estimate the parameters of a distribution that we
think represents the distribution of our variable in the underlying
population. It will also allow you to visualize how the estimated
distribution compares to the actual distribution of your sample
data.</p></li>
<li><p>It will demonstrate how to use ggplot to add multiple layers to
the same graph.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, though, that box plots are a good way to visualize data
like these, so if you are not comfortable making these density plots on
your own, you may stick with box plots for visualizing your own
data.</p>
<div id="null-model" class="section level5">
<h5>Null model</h5>
<p>We will start with the graph for the null model. We will take this in
steps, first creating a histogram of our sample data, which should be
familiar from Lesson 4. Then we will add another layer to the plot with
the distribution estimated from our model.</p>
<p>Let’s create our histogram. Our null model assumes the distribution
of plant density does not depend on the herbivory treatment, so for this
graph, we will just make a single histogram of all of our density data.
This code is the same code we used to histogram these data in Lesson 4,
with one change. In Lesson 4, we graphed the frequency of each range of
plant density values, i.e., the count of observations that fell within
each range. However, when we add our estimated distribution from the
model, we will be plotting the probability density of each possible
plant value. The probability density is not on the same scale as the
frequency because the frequency depends on the total sample size as well
as the probability of observing each range of plant density values.
Therefore, in order to compare the sample distribution and the estimated
distribution, we will convert the frequency to the probability density.
You can see this step in the second line of code below, as an argument
in the <code>geom_histogram</code> function. The argument we add is
<code>aes(y=after_stat(density))</code>. This argument tells R to
calculate the probability density and use that as our y variable in
place of the frequency. Try it out!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = civu, aes(x = density_2006))+
  geom_histogram(aes(y=after_stat(density)),bins = 10) +
  labs(x = &quot;Density in 2006&quot;, y = &quot;Probability Density&quot;) +
  theme_classic()</code></pre>
<p><img src="RHandbook_6_files/figure-html/null_hist-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Now we have a graph showing the distribution of the plant density
data from our sample. Next, we will add the distribution estimated from
our model. We have the mean and the standard deviation of the
distribution in our model output. We will use these to create a data set
representing the distribution that we can add to our graph.</p>
<p>We’ll start by saving the mean and standard deviation from our null
model. If you ran all of the code from Lesson 5, you should already have
the standard deviation saved as a variable. Check now by typing the
variable name <code>null_sd_civu</code> into your console. If you get an
error saying this variable does not exist, go back to your lesson 5 code
and run the lines of code in the Model Variance section of Lesson 5.1.
To save the mean as a variable, we need to pull the value out the of
model coefficients from the null model. We can indicate to R that we
want the coefficients from the civu_null model using the
<code>civu_null$coefficients</code> command. Then we tell R which
coefficient we want, using brackets to index the vector of coefficients.
In this case, there is only one coefficient, which is the mean, so we
will put a 1 inside the brackets to pull out the first (and only)
coefficient.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Save distribution mean from null model parameters
null_mean_civu &lt;- civu_null$coefficients[1]</code></pre>
<p>Next what we need to do is create a new data frame to represent the
estimated distribution. This data frame will need to have two columns:
one with a range of possible plant density values and one with the
probability (probability density, technically) of observing each of
those plant density values.</p>
<p>First, we will create our variable with range of possible plant
density values. We will have our values range from 1 to 70, which covers
the full range of values we observed in the data. To create this
variable, we will use the <code>seq</code> function. We need to provide
the function with two arguments, representing the first and last value
in the sequence we want.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Create vector with a range of plant density values from 1 to 70
density_range &lt;- seq(1,70)</code></pre>
<p>Then we need to calculate the probability of observing each of these
values, based on the parameters (mean and standard deviation) calculated
for our estimated distribution in our null model. Remember, in this type
of model, we assume our data are normally distributed, so we will be
making these probability calculations based on a normal probability
distribution with the mean and standard deviation from our model. We can
do this in R using the <code>dnorm</code> function. If we provide the
function with the values we want to calculate the probability of, the
mean, and the standard deviation, it will calculate the probability
density for each value.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Calculate the probability (density) of each plant density based on normal distribution with mean and sd calculated from null model
prob &lt;- dnorm(density_range, mean = null_mean_civu, sd = null_sd_civu)</code></pre>
<p>Okay, now we have our range of values and the probability density of
observing each values based on the distribution estimated from our null
model. We will put these together into a data frame, which is the format
required by ggplot. Then we will be able to add the distribution to our
graph!</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Put density range and probabilities in a data frame
civu_null_data &lt;- data.frame(Density = density_range, Probability = prob)
# View top few rows of data frame
head(civu_null_data)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   Density  Probability
## 1       1 0.0007194537
## 2       2 0.0009001005
## 3       3 0.0011185103
## 4       4 0.0013805424
## 5       5 0.0016924673
## 6       6 0.0020608748</code></pre>
<p>Time for the final step in making our graph: adding a layer to our
previous histogram to show the estimated distribution. We will just add
one more line of code underneath the <code>geom_histogram</code>
function to add the layer. This time, we will use the
<code>geom_density</code> function, which will plot a smooth
distribution instead of dividing the data into discrete bins. The catch
here is that we are using a new data frame, so inside the
<code>geom_density</code> function, we need to provide ggplot with the
new data frame and the new x (plant density values) and y (probability)
variables we want to graph. The format for this is the same as the
format we use in the <code>ggplot</code> function in the first line of
code. The other argument we need to add is the
<code>stat = "identity"</code> argument, which tells ggplot to use the
probability values given in the data set instead of doing summary
calculations with the data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = civu, aes(x = density_2006))+
  geom_histogram(aes(y=after_stat(density)),bins = 10) +
  geom_density(data = civu_null_data, aes(x = Density, y = Probability), stat=&quot;identity&quot;) +
  labs(x = &quot;Density in 2006&quot;, y = &quot;Probability Density&quot;) +
  theme_classic()</code></pre>
<p><img src="RHandbook_6_files/figure-html/null_density-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>There we have it! The histogram on our graph shows in the
distribution of plant density in our sample data, and the smooth curve
shows our estimated distribution of plant density in the underlying
population. We can quickly visualize the mean plant density, the amount
of variation, and how well our sample data match our estimated
distribution.</p>
</div>
<div id="alternative-model" class="section level5">
<h5>Alternative model</h5>
<p>Now we will repeat the above process for our alternative model. Our
approach will be the same, but this time we will be graphing separate
distributions for the herbivory and no herbivory treatments. This will
be a little more complicated, but it will also give you a chance to play
with color and other settings in ggplot to make the visualization more
clear!</p>
<p>We will again start by making the histogram of sample data. We will
graph the data for each treatment in a different color, so we can see
how herbivory affects the distribution of plant density. To do this, we
will add a “colour = herbivory” argument <em>inside</em> the
<code>aes</code> function in the <code>geom_histogram</code> command.
This tells ggplot to create a histogram of plant densities for each
treatment, and use a separate color for each. The other argument we will
add <em>outside</em> the <code>aes</code> function is the “fill = NA”
argument, which tells ggplot not to add a fill color to the histogram
bars. This will just make it easier to see everything after we add the
other layer.</p>
<p>We will also manually set the colors we want ggplot to use. The
default color palette used by R is not colorblind friendly, so I always
like to choose colorblind friendly options instead. There are a number
of websites where you can find colorblind friendly palettes. I will post
some links in the R discussion forum on Canvas. Many have accompanying R
packages you are welcome to explore, but I often just look up the hex
codes for the colors I want and use those in my code. We set the colors
using the <code>scale_colour_manual</code> function, and we can simply
provide ggplot with the hex codes we want using the “values”
argument.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = civu, aes(x = density_2006))+
  geom_histogram(aes(y=after_stat(density), colour = herbivory), fill = NA, bins = 10) +
  scale_colour_manual(values=c(&quot;#ce9642&quot;,&quot;#3b7c70&quot;)) +
  labs(x = &quot;Density in 2006&quot;, y = &quot;Probability Density&quot;) +
  theme_classic()</code></pre>
<p><img src="RHandbook_6_files/figure-html/alt_hist-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>On this new graph, we can see the plant density in the presence of
herbivores in yellow and the plant density in the absence of herbivores
in green, quickly showing the difference between the two.</p>
<p>It is now time to add the estimated distributions from our
alternative model. First we need to set up the data frame with the data
representing our distributions. This time, we will need to calculate two
sets of probability densities: one for each herbivory treatment. Check
that you have saved the standard deviation for the alternative model by
typing <code>alt_sd_civu</code> into the console. Go back and run the
Model Variance code from Lesson 5 as necessary.</p>
<p>Next, calculate the means for each treatment. Remember, in this time
of model, when we include a predictor variable, we are calculating
different means for each treatment, so we need to calculate two means
here. The mean for herbivory = 0 (herbivores present) is simply the
intercept from the model and the mean for herbivory = 1 (herbivores
absent) is the intercept plus the herbivory coefficient, which is the
second values in the coefficients vector from the model. (If this
doesn’t make sense go back to Lesson 5 to review it, or ask me.)</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Save distribution means from altnernative model parameters
mean_civu_0 &lt;- civu_alt$coefficients[1]
mean_civu_1 &lt;- civu_alt$coefficients[1] + civu_alt$coefficients[2]</code></pre>
<p>Now we have the values we need to calculate the probability
densities, so lets create our range of plant density values and
calculate the associated probabilities, again using the
<code>dnorm</code> function. We will need to do this twice, once for
each herbivory treatment, but we will put the values together into a
single vector using the <code>c</code> function. For example, for our
plant density values, and then we will combine together two sequences
from 1 to 70 into a single vector. Then, to calculate the probabilities,
we will do the calculation on one of the plant density ranges using the
mean for the herbivory = 0 treatment, and then we will do the
calculation again using the mean for the herbivory = 1 treatment,
combining the two sets of densities together into one vector. We will
also need a third vector to represent our treatment. This vector will
contain a series of 70 zeros (one for each plant density value) followed
by a series of 70 ones.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Create vector with a range of plant density values from 1 to 70. Repeat for herbivory = 0 and herbivory = 1
density_range &lt;- seq(1:70)
density_range_alt &lt;- c(density_range, density_range)

# Calculate the probability (density) of each plant density based on normal distribution with mean and sd calculated from null model
prob_alt &lt;- c(dnorm(density_range, mean = mean_civu_0, sd = alt_sd_civu),dnorm(density_range, mean = mean_civu_1, sd = alt_sd_civu))

# Create a vector with herbivory treatment (0 or 1)
herb &lt;- as.factor(c(rep(0,70),rep(1,70)))</code></pre>
<p>Finally, put together your three variables into a data frame.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Put density range, probabilities, and herbivory treatment in a data frame
civu_alt_data &lt;- data.frame(Density = density_range_alt, Probability = prob_alt, Herbivory = herb)
# View top few rows of data frame
head(civu_alt_data)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   Density Probability Herbivory
## 1       1 0.005551099         0

<p>We now have the data frame we need to create our final graph, where
we add our estimated distributions to our histograms. We will do this as
before, but this time, we will add the <code>geom_density</code>
function before the <code>geom_histogram</code> function to plot the
denisty underneath the histogram. The code is the same we used for the
null model, but this time we add additional “fill” and “color” arguments
inside the <code>aes</code> function to graph the lines and fill for the
two distributions in different colors. We also add another argument at
the end of the <code>geom_density</code> function (“alpha = 0.3”) to
make the fill color transparent. The only other thing we need to do is
manually set the fill color the way we did for the line color. The
syntax is the same as for line color, but this time the function is
<code>scale_fill_manual</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = civu, aes(x = density_2006))+
  geom_density(data = civu_alt_data, aes(x = Density, y = Probability, fill = Herbivory, colour = Herbivory), stat=&quot;identity&quot;, alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y=after_stat(density), colour = herbivory),fill = NA , bins = 10) +
  scale_colour_manual(values=c(&quot;#ce9642&quot;,&quot;#3b7c70&quot;)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c(&quot;#ce9642&quot;,&quot;#3b7c70&quot;)) +
  labs(x = &quot;Density in 2006&quot;, y = &quot;Probability Density&quot;) +
  theme_classic()</code></pre>
<p><img src="RHandbook_6_files/figure-html/alt_density-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Here we have our final graph, with the bars of the histograms showing
the sample distributions and the shaded density plots showing the
estimated population distributions for the two herbivory treatments
based on the alternative model. If you would like, feel free to play
around with some of the parameters like the number of bins in the
histogram, the alpha (transparency) value, and the colors, to see how
that impacts the aesthetics of the graph!</p>

<div id="continuous-predictor-variable" class="section level3">
<h3>5.2 Continuous predictor variable</h3>
<p>We will now move on to our tree example with a continuous independent
variable and a continuous dependent variable. This will be easy compared
to the previous set of graphs you made! To visualize these models, we
will use scatter plots of the sample data along with best fit lines to
represent the distributions predicted by the models.</p>
<p>If you haven’t already, use the script file from Lesson 5 to run all
of the code you wrote for the tree example, including the building of
both the null and alternative models. Be sure you first have your
working directory set to the folder containing the DataFrameExample data
set.</p>
<div id="null-model-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Null model</h4>
<p>Let’s start with the null model: temperature does not affect the
growth of trees. We’ll make the scatter plot of the sample data first.
This is the same method we used to make scatter plots in Lesson 4.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = tree, aes(x = Temperature, y = Growth))+
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = &quot;Temperature&quot;, y = &quot;Growth&quot;) +
  theme_classic()</code></pre>
<p><img src="RHandbook_6_files/figure-html/null_scatter-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Now we will add our best fit line. To add our best fit line, we will
need the intercept value from our tree_null model. We will save this as
a variable called <code>tree_mean</code>. Then we will use this value to
add our line. Because the null model assumes no effect of temperature on
growth, we will be adding a line with a slope of zero and the intercept
from our model. We will add it to the scatter plot we created above
using the <code>geom_hline</code> function, which will add a horizontal
line. The argument we need to give this function is the value of the
intercept, which is our <code>tree_mean</code> variable. I also added a
“linewidth” argument to make the line thicker and a coulour argument to
make the line blue.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Save mean value from null model
tree_mean &lt;- tree_null$coefficients[1]

# Make graph
ggplot(data = tree, aes(x = Temperature, y = Growth))+
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = tree_mean, linewidth = 1, colour = &quot;blue&quot;) +
  labs(x = &quot;Temperature&quot;, y = &quot;Growth&quot;) +
  theme_classic()</code></pre>
<p><img src="RHandbook_6_files/figure-html/null_bestfit-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Finally, we will add shading around the line to show our estimate of
variation (measured as standard deviation) from our null model. Type
0.0313404 into your console to make sure you have this standard
deviation saved as a object, and run the Model Variation code from
Lesson 5.2 again if necessary.</p>
<p>We will add the shading using the <code>geom_ribbon</code> function.
We need to provide this function with minimum and maximum y values to
represent the lower and upper bounds of the ribbon. Our lower and upper
bounds will be based on the standard deviation. The upper bound will be
our mean estimate plus the standard deviation and the lower bound will
be the mean estimate minus the standard deviation. I also added the
alpha argument at the end of the function to make the fill of the ribbon
transparent.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Make graph
ggplot(data = tree, aes(x = Temperature, y = Growth))+
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = tree_mean, linewidth = 1, colour = &quot;blue&quot;) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = tree_mean - null_sd_tree, ymax = tree_mean + null_sd_tree),alpha = 0.2) +
  labs(x = &quot;Temperature&quot;, y = &quot;Growth&quot;) +
  theme_classic()</code></pre>
<p><img src="RHandbook_6_files/figure-html/null_ribbon-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Now we can see our model output overlaid on the raw data points from
our sample data to get a visual of how well our model matches our data
and how much variation in our data is not explained by our model.</p>
</div>
<div id="alternative-model-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Alternative model</h4>
<p>Now we’ll move on to our alternative model, which includes an effect
of temperature on the tree growth. This might actually be the easiest
graph we have made in the lesson so far because ggplot has the capacity
to run this linear model itself and add the output to the graph without
us needing to manually add the parameters!</p>
<p>We will use the <code>geom_point</code> function to plot the sample
data points, as before, but this time we will use the
<code>geom_smooth</code> function to add the line respresenting our
model. Because we are using the same data set and variables that we
specified in the opening <code>ggplot</code> function, the only argument
we need to add is the method we want ggplot to use to build and
parameterize our model. We set the method to “lm”, short for “linear
model”, which is the same type of model we used in Lesson 5.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = tree, aes(x = Temperature, y = Growth))+
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;) +
  labs(x = &quot;Temperature&quot;, y = &quot;Growth&quot;) +
  theme_classic()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## `geom_smooth()` using formula = &#39;y ~ x&#39;</code></pre>
<p><img src="RHandbook_6_files/figure-html/alt_scatter-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Like with our previous graph, you will see a best fit line
representing the mean of the distribution, which now varies with
temperature, and shading to represent variation, or uncertainty, in the
mean. The biggest differnce is that this time the shading represents the
95% confidence interval, rather than the standard deviation. The 95%
confidence interval basically says that if we repeated our experiment
over and over again, we would expect the mean value estimated from our
data to fall within that interval 95% of the time. Like the standard
deviation, it is method of representing the variation in our data. Both
measures (as well as variance and standard deviation) are acceptable
ways of representing the variation. What is important is that when you
present your results, you make it clear in your figure captions and text
what measure of variation you used.</p>
<p>You have now gone through the whole process of building and
visualizing statistical models! In the upcoming lessons, we will focus
on how we do formal comparisons of models to determine which model(s)
best represent our data.</p>
