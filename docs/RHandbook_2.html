<h2>Lesson 2: R BASICS</h2>
<div id="basic-r-commands" class="section level3">
<h3>2.1 Basic R commands</h3>
<p>At it’s most basic, R can function like a powerful calculator. You
can use all of the basic arithmetic operators in R, as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>addition: +</li>
<li>subtraction: -</li>
<li>multiplication: *</li>
<li>division: /</li>
<li>exponentiation: ^</li>
</ol>
<p>Try them out! Type each of the following commands, shown in the grey
boxes below, into the console in RStudio, and R will give you the answer
in the console, just below your line of code!(Note: The words that come
after the “#” symbol are comments, not code. They are just notes about
the code, and R will ignore them when it runs the code.)</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Addition
3+6</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 9</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Subtraction
4-9</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] -5</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Multiplication
6*7</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 42</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Division
8/2</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 4</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Exponentiation
3^5</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 243</code></pre>
<p>R also has built-in functions that can be used for other types of
arithmetic calculations. There are many, but a few examples are listed
below. In the examples, “x” can be any number or set of numbers.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>log(x) # natural logarithm of x
log10(x) # logarithm base 10 of x

sqrt(x) # square root of x
abs(x) # absolute value of x</code></pre>
<p>Go ahead and try out these functions. You can use any value you want
in place of x!</p>
</div>
<div id="saving-and-recalling-values" class="section level3">
<h3>2.2 Saving and recalling values</h3>
<p>To start harnessing the full power of R, we want to be able to save
our values, so we can use them in additional calculations. This section
will cover how to save values as variables and how to use those
variables in new calculations.</p>
<p>Let’s say you are studying the population size of a plant. You go out
and count the number of plants in three different plots. Then you also
want to calculate the total number of plants across all three plots.</p>
<p>First, lets save the number of plants each plot as three separate
variables. Use <code>&lt;-</code> to assign a value to a variable. I
recommend you give your variables names that are short but
informative.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot1 &lt;- 4
plot2 &lt;- 7
plot3 &lt;- 6</code></pre>
<p>After you run these three lines of code, you should see your three
variables listed in your Environment window in the upper right-hand
corner of RStudio. This can help you keep track of the variables and
other objects you create in R.</p>
<p>Now let’s use our variables to calculate the total number of plants
across all three plots and save that total as a new variable.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>total &lt;- plot1 + plot2 + plot3</code></pre>
<p>If you now want to view the value of the total plot count, just type
in the variable name (Note that R is case-sensitive):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>total</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 17</code></pre>
<p>We could continue to use any of these variables in additional
calculations.</p>
</div>
<div id="types-of-r-objects" class="section level3">
<h3>2.3 Types of R objects</h3>
<p>In the previous section we created a type of R object called a
variable, which is just a single value. A variable is just one of many
object types you can create in R. We will look at a couple other types
here.</p>
<div id="vectors" class="section level4">
<h4>Vectors</h4>
<p>A vector is a collection of multiple values stored together in a
single object. Lets again work with our plant example from above. This
time, instead of saving out plant counts as separate variables, we will
store them together in a singe vector. To do so, we will use a new
function, the concatenate function: <code>c()</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plant_counts &lt;- c(4,7,6)</code></pre>
<p>If you view this vector object, you will see all values listed.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plant_counts</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 4 7 6</code></pre>
<p>Saving multiple values in a single object can help simplify our code
and the calculations we do, especially if we are working with a lot of
numbers. Let’s now take a look at some functions we can use to do
calculations with the numbers stored in vectors.</p>
<p>When we worked with variables above, we added our plot counts
together to get the total numbers of plants across all plots. We can use
a shortcut to calculate the total using our vector and the
<code>sum</code> function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sum(plant_counts)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 17</code></pre>
<p>We can also calculate things like the mean and standard deviation of
the values in vectors:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mean(plant_counts)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 5.666667</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>sd(plant_counts)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 1.527525</code></pre>
<p>Okay, so we stored all these numbers in a vector, but what if we just
want to work with one of the values from a vector? Well, we can do that
by providing R with an index to tell it which of the values from the
vector we want. For example, let’s say we want to save the plant counts
from each plot as separate variables. We can do that as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot1 &lt;- plant_counts[1]
plot2 &lt;- plant_counts[2]
plot3 &lt;- plant_counts[3]</code></pre>
<p>The indices are the numbers inside the brackets, telling R the
position of the value we want from the vector.Single brackets are always
used for indexing vectors.</p>
<p>We can also select multiple values from a vector in various ways. If
we want multiple adjacent values, we can use the colon symbol
(<code>:</code>) to select the range of values we want. If we wanted to
select the first two values from our <code>plant_counts</code> vector,
we would do that as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot1_2 &lt;- plant_counts[1:2]</code></pre>
<p>If we want to select non-adjacent values, we can again make use of
our concatenate function to do that. We will essentially create a vector
with the list of the indices of the values we want. To select the first
and third values from our <code>plant_counts</code> vector, we could do
the following:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot1_3 &lt;- plant_counts[c(1,3)]</code></pre>
<p>We can also tell R to remove values from a vector, which is useful if
we want to include most of the values and only remove a few. Another way
of creating the <code>plot1_3</code> vector would be to remove the
second value. We do that using the minus symbol:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot1_3 &lt;- plant_counts[-2]</code></pre>
<p>We can also remove multiple values by combining the minus symbol with
either the colon to tell R to remove a range of values or with the
concatenate function to specify individuals values we want to remove.
Here are examples of both:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot1 &lt;- plant_counts[-(2:3)]
plot2 &lt;- plant_counts[-c(1,3)]</code></pre>
<p>What you might be starting to notice is that there are often multiple
ways to do the same thing. Sometimes one strategy will be more efficient
than other, but often multiple strategies will work! There is rarely one
correct way to write code (but there are lots of wrong ways to write
code).</p>
</div>
<div id="data-frames" class="section level4">
<h4>Data frames</h4>
<p>Another type of R object we will work with frequently in this class
is a data frame. Think of a data frame as the R version of a
spreadsheet. You can have columns for different variables, with rows for
your observations of each variable. You can create data frames directly
in R or you can import them from another file on your computer (or
download them from the internet, in some cases). In the next lesson, we
will cover data frames in more detail, including how to important them.
Here, we will create a simple data frame in R, so you can see the basic
structure of a data frame.</p>
<p>Let’s continue with our plant count example from above. Previously,
we stored the data either as variables or as vectors. Now, lets put it
into a data frame instead. We will have one column with our plot numbers
and one with our plot counts. To create the data frame, we will use the
<code>date.frame()</code> function. Inside the parentheses of the
function, we will tell R what variables we want and what data we want to
add for each variable. Here is one way we could create our plant counts
data frame:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plant_data &lt;- data.frame(Plot=c(1:3),Plant_count=plant_counts)
plant_data</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   Plot Plant_count
## 1    1           4
## 2    2           7
## 3    3           6</code></pre>
<p>When you view the data frame, you can now see two colums: the first
with your plot numbers and the second with the plant count for each
plot. Now let’s break down the code we used to create the data frame.
First, note that we are saving this as a new object called
<code>plant_data</code>. Because we are creating it with the
<code>data.frame</code> function, it will be a data frame oject. Inside
the parentheses of the <code>data.frame</code> function, we told R to
create two different variable, one called “Plot” and one called
“Plant_count”. We tell R these are two separate variable by separating
them by a comma. If we wanted, we could add additional variable. We are
not limited to two. To tell R what data to add to each variable, we
first use the equals sign after the variable name and then tell R what
numbers to add. For the Plot variable, I again used the concatenate
function to tell R that the Plot variable should have the numbers 1
through 3, in order. To create the Plant_counts variable, I simply told
R to use the <code>plant_counts</code> vector we already created.</p>
<p>Once we have created a data frame, it is possible to extract
particular data from the data frame, if we don’t want to work with all
of the data at once. If we want to extract a particular column of data,
we can do that by telling R the name of the data frame, followed by the
<code>$</code> symbol, followed by the name of the column we want:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plant_counts &lt;- plant_data$Plant_count
plant_counts</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 4 7 6</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the column we extracted is now in the form of a
vector!</p>
<p>We can also extract a single value using indexing, similar to the way
we extracted values from a vector. When we are working with data frames,
though, we will use double brackets, and we have to give R two indices,
one for the row and one for the column, in that order.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot1 &lt;- plant_data[[1,2]]
plot1</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 4</code></pre>
<p>Here we extracted the value in the first row and second column from
the <code>plant_data</code> data frame, which is the plant count from
plot 1.</p>
<p>In the next lesson, we will look at several additional ways to
manipulate data frames in R, specifically focusing on using the
<strong>tidyverse</strong> family of packages, that includes packages
designed for working with data frames.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="functions" class="section level3">
<h3>2.4 Functions</h3>
<p>As you worked through the first three sections in this lesson, you
practiced using a number of different functions. Now that you have seen
and used a few examples, we will go some general aspects of
functions.</p>
<p>All functions in R have the same basic structure, which is helpful
for learning new functions. Whenever you use a function, you will first
type the name of the function (e.g., <code>mean</code> or
<code>c</code>), followed by parentheses. Inside the parentheses, you
will provide the “arguments” for the function. But what are arguments?
The arguments are the inputs that R needs to carry out the function.
Functions usually have at least one required argument, and they often
have additional optional arguments as well.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the <code>mean</code> function as an example. We used
the mean function above to calculate the mean number of plants in our
plant counts vector:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mean(plant_counts)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 5.666667</code></pre>
<p>The mean function has one required argument: x, which is the set of
numbers for which you want to calculate the mean. We provided the
<code>plant_counts</code> vector as the object for that argument. There
are also additional optional arguments for the <code>mean</code>
function. The optional arguments usually have default values that are
used if you do not specify those arguments in your code. Often the
defaults are what we want, but other times, we might want to change
them. An example for our <code>mean</code> function is the “na.rm”
argument. This argument tells R how to handle missing data points (NAs)
in the data. The default if for this argument to be set to “FALSE”,
meaning R will not remove NAs from the data, and, as a result, if you
have any NAs in the data, you will get NA as your mean. This is useful
for detecting places where you have missing data if you didn’t know they
were missing. However, sometimes we might want R to remove the NAs and
calculate the mean of the remaining data points. To do this, we would
include the na.rm argument in our code and change its value to “TRUE”
(or simply “T”). You can see the difference below, where I add an NA to
our plant_counts vector, and then calculate the mean using both
options.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plant_counts &lt;- c(plant_counts,NA)
mean(plant_counts)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] NA</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>mean(plant_counts, na.rm=T)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 5.666667</code></pre>
<p>Notice that when I provided the argument for x (the set of numbers),
I didn’t include the name of the argument, I did not specify the name of
the argument, but I did specify the name of the na.rm argument, followed
by an equal sign before giving the value for that argument. If you give
R the arguments in order, without skipping any, you do not need to
specify the name of the argument. But if you list them in the wrong
order or skip arguments, you do need to specify the name. In this
example, I know that x is the first argument, but na.rm is the third. I
could therefore get away with not giving the name of the first argument,
but I had that one in the right position, but I did need to specify the
name of the na.rm argument because I skipped an optional argument and
had the na.rm argument in the second position instead of the third.</p>
<p>But how do you know what a function does, what arguments you need in
a function and what the correct order of the arguments is? We will cover
that in the next section.</p>
</div>
<div id="getting-help-in-r" class="section level3">
<h3>2.5 Getting help in R</h3>
<p>If you forget how to use a function, need to learn a new function, or
aren’t sure where to begin to carry out a procedure in R, never fear!
There are a lot of ways to get help. You are always welcome to use any
resources to help with your coding. This handbook will stay on the
Canvas page, and you can return to it at any time to refresh your memory
on the things it covers. Another excellent way to get help is to make
use of the internet. There is a huge community of R users out there, so
there are tons of resources online. If you do a search for a problem you
are having or a procedure you need to carry out, I can almost guarantee
you will find answers online. Are you on Twitter? Believe it or not,
that is another great resource. Post your question with #rstats, and you
might find a helpful R expert will answer it for you! I have heard the
#rstats community is both helpful and friendly!</p>
<p>R also has its own help pages for every function, both functions in
base R and functions in packages you download. Sometimes they are a bit
technical, but they can be helpful for reminding you what functions do
and what arguments you need to include in the function. There are a
couple of ways to access the help pages. In RStudio, there is a Help tab
in the bottom right-hand corner. You can search for a function or a
topic in this help tab. You can also type code directly into the console
to access a help page. If you know the name of the function you want,
type <code>?</code> followed by the function name. For example if you
want information about the standard deviation function, you would type
<code>?sd</code>. The help page will open in the bottom right-hand
corner on RStudio. If you can’t remember the name of the function, you
can search for a keyword instead, using <code>$$</code> followed by the
keyword, and you will get a list of functions that are related to your
keyword. If you knew you wanted to calculate the standard deviation, but
didn’t remember the function was <code>sd</code>, for example, you could
type <code>??standarddeviation</code>. Note that you can’t include a
space in your keyword.</p>
